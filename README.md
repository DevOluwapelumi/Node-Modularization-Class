Node Modularization to link to frontend(React.js + vite)


In JavaScript and Node.js, modularization is a common practice for organizing your code into reusable and maintainable modules. Modules help you encapsulate functionality and prevent polluting the global scope. You can create a class in a Node.js module by exporting a constructor function or a class definition.

Here's an example of creating a simple class in a Node.js module:

Create a new JavaScript file for your class, let's call it "MyClass.js":
      // MyClass.js
      
      class MyClass {
        constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
      
        sayHello() {
          console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
        }
      }
      
      module.exports = MyClass;

In this example, we've defined a simple MyClass class with a constructor that takes a name as a parameter and a sayHello method.

Now, in another JavaScript file where you want to use this class, you can require and create instances of it:
            // main.js
            
            const MyClass = require('./MyClass');
            
            const instance1 = new MyClass('Alice');
            const instance2 = new MyClass('Bob');
            
            instance1.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, Alice!
            instance2.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, Bob!

In "main.js," we import the MyClass module using require('./MyClass'), create instances of the class, and call the sayHello method on each instance.

This is a basic example of modularizing a class in Node.js. You can expand on this by adding more methods and properties to your class, as well as organizing your code into multiple modules for a larger project.
